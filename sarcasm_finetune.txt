Oh great, another Monday-just what I needed to improve my mood.
I just love waiting in line for hours; it's the highlight of my week.
Because who doesn't enjoy a good traffic jam on the way to work?
Fantastic! My phone died right when I needed it most.
Wow, I failed the test? Clearly, studying all night was the best use of my time.
Awesome, the elevator's broken again-guess I'll get my cardio in.
Lost my keys again? Oh, what a surprise!
My internet went out during my meeting-such perfect timing.
Oh, you're late again? I totally didn't expect that at all.
Of course the coffee machine's empty-why would it ever work?
Oh, another influencer review? That's definitely unbiased.

My computer just froze again-what a reliable machine!

Auto-correct strikes again. Thanks for changing "great" to "grate," really helpful.

Nothing screams productivity like 17 Zoom calls in a day.

Wow, another inspirational quote on my feed-life-changing stuff.

Yes, I do love it when updates break everything that used to work.

My favorite thing is software crashing right before I hit save.
Oh good, a meeting that could've been an email!

Sure, I'll totally finish that report by noon-with my magic time machine.

Amazing, group projects-because nothing says efficiency like five people doing one person's job.

Another spreadsheet? Be still, my beating heart.

Yay, another "mandatory" fun event. Count me in!

Oh, you didn't read the syllabus? What a shock.

Late-night emails from my boss? Just what dreams are made of.

Wow, $12 for a bottle of water-what a steal!

Another automated phone tree? Love talking to robots instead of humans.

Yes, I came here for the privilege of being ignored by sales associates.

Of course the item on sale is out of stock-why wouldn't it be?

Sure, your app is totally user-friendly. I only cried twice.

Thank you, customer service, for putting me on hold for 45 minutes. A real pleasure.

Oh, your unsolicited advice really changed my life.

Thanks for the passive-aggressive comment-really warmed my heart.

Wow, you remembered my birthday... two days late. So thoughtful.

No, really, I love explaining how to use the TV remote. Again.

You're right, telling me to "just relax" really fixed all my problems.

Yay, salad again-my taste buds are thrilled.

Oh great, another 5 AM workout. Can't wait!

Water? What a treat. It's not like I wanted flavor or anything.

Nothing like a treadmill to simulate the joy of going nowhere.

Doctor says I need more sleep? Shocking revelation!

Wow, another live-action reboot-Hollywood's on fire!

Oh yay, a new social media app. Just what the world needs.

Of course that reality show got renewed. Quality content like that is rare.

Another celebrity skincare line? How totally original.

That's exactly what I hoped would happen-if I hated myself.

I just love when people interrupt me mid-sentence.

Oh good, someone explaining the joke-makes it so much funnier.

Nothing screams success like burning toast.

I thrive on chaos-it keeps me young.

Best idea ever: replying all to a company-wide email.
